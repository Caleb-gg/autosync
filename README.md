# AutoSync

AutoSync is an Android application that bridges the gap between **auto repair shops** and **their customers**.  
It allows businesses to manage ongoing car repairs while giving customers visibility and convenience in finding trusted mechanics.

AutoSync provides two types of user accounts:
- **Customer Accounts:** Search for nearby mechanic shops and view their available services.
- **Business Accounts:** Add, update, and track vehicles currently being worked on.  

## Overview

When a business adds a new car to their list, they can **enter the VIN**, and the app automatically fetches the vehicle details from the [NHTSA Vehicle API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/).  
Each car is displayed in a **RecyclerView** using **CardViews**, and the mechanic can track repair progress using a **status spinner** with three options:
- Waiting for Parts
- In Progress
- Completed
